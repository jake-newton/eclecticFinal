This visibility and exposure should be extended to everyone, not just those fluent in website design and development. <strong>Everyone should have the ability to pioneer this new frontier.</strong></p>

                        <p className="vision">I was born and raised in Central and Southern Arizona, and throughout my life I have been <strong>passionate about solving problems,</strong> particularly logic problems and philosophy. Following this path, I ended up getting a degree in Criminology with a minor in Philosophy from NAU, and I went on to apply to my local Police Department. Throughout my training process and on into the academy however, my passion was still deeply rooted philosophy, <strong>particularly in logic</strong>, and I knew the best way for me to get back to what I really loved was web development.<br></br>    <br></br>I enrolled in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://lambdaschool.com/"><strong>Lambda School</strong></a> to further pursue this dream, during my journey there I studied <strong>Web Development,</strong> and was tasked with building multiple collaborative projects and individual assignments and assessments. These projects consisted of everything from a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sleepmood.netlify.app/"><strong>user-friendly marking page</strong></a> for a web application, up to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://omega2020.netlify.app/"><strong>fully fledged web application</strong></a> produced with React and connected to a fully deployed database and backend. Now, a year from that initial realization, I have completed my Full Stack Web Development endorsement from Lambda School and have stepped full time into the world of Full Stack Web Development to continue to <strong>solve problems and build amazing things. </strong></p>
